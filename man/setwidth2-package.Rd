\title{Automatically set the value of options("width") when the terminal
  emulator is resized}
\description{
Inspired by and based on the original 'setwidth' package by Jakson Alves de
Aquino, but extended for cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).
For best experience, it is recommended to have the 'later' package installed
(used for event handling and timer fallback).
This package should not be used with Graphical User Interfaces, such as
Windows RGui, RStudio, RKward, JGR, Rcmdr and other interfaces which have
their own engine to display R output. The functions of this package only
work if R is compiled for Linux, macOS, or Windows systems and it is running
interactively in a terminal emulator. The terminal emulator might have been
called by a text editor, such as Vim, Gedit, Kate or Geany.
}
\details{
The package will print information on the R Console if its
`setwidth2.verbose` option was set to a numeric value bigger than zero:

\preformatted{
options(setwidth2.verbose = 1) # Print startup message
options(setwidth2.verbose = 2) # Print error message when unable to set width
options(setwidth2.verbose = 3) # Print width value
}

The package does not have any user visible R function. When it is loaded,
a platform-specific event handler in C is installed to update
`options("width")` whenever the terminal size changes. The handler is only
activated if R is running interactively and the terminal environment is
suitable (e.g., `interactive() == TRUE` and the `TERM` environment variable
is not empty or set to `"dumb"`).

On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), the width is updated by polling the
terminal size using the event loop (if available) or by using a timer
fallback. On Windows, a timer is used to periodically check the console
width.

To manually test whether the package is working properly on your system you 
may repeatedly resize the terminal emulator and print a long vector, like 
1:300.

To disable the automatic setting of `options("width")` do:

\preformatted{
detach("package:setwidth2", unload = TRUE)
}
}
\examples{
options(setwidth2.verbose = 1)
print(getOption("width"))
}
