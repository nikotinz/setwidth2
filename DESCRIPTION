Description: Automatically sets the value of options("width") when the
   terminal emulator is resized. Inspired by and based on the original 'setwidth'
   package by Jakson Alves de Aquino and Dominique-Laurent Couturier, but 
   extended for cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows) in interactive 
   R sessions. You need to have the 'later' package installed (used for event 
   handling and timer fallback).
